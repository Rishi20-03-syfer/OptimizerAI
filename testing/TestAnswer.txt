PRACTICAL QUESTIONS
1.Write a Python program to perform all arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, **) on two numbers provided by the user.

num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
print("Addition: ", num1+num2)
print("Subtraction: ", num1-num2)
print("Multiplication: ", num1*num2)
print("Division: ", num1/num2)
print("Modulus: ", num1%num2)
print("Exponentiation: ", num1**num2)

2.Write a Python program to check if a given number is positive, negative, or zero.

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num > 0:
    print("Number is positive")
elif num < 0:
    print("Number is negative")
else:
    print("Number is zero")

3.Write a Python program to find the largest of three numbers using nested if-else statements.
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
num3 = int(input("Enter third number: "))
if num1 >= num2 and num1 >= num3:
    print("Number 1 is largest")
elif num2 >= num1 and num2 >= num3:
    print("Number 2 is largest")
else:
    print("Number 3 is largest")

4.Write a Python program to check if a year is a leap year or not.

year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
if (year%400==0) or (year%4==0 and year%100!=0):
	print("This is a leap year")
else:
	print("This is not a leap year")

5.Write a Python program to check if a number is divisible by 5 and 11 using conditional statements.

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num%5==0 and num%11==0:
    print("Number is divisible by 5 and 11")
else:
    print("Number is not divisible by 5 and 11")

6.Write a Python program that checks whether an entered alphabet is a vowel or a consonant using conditional statements.

alphabet = input("Enter an alphabet: ")
if alphabet == 'a' or alphabet == 'e' or alphabet == 'i' or alphabet == 'o' or alphabet == 'u':
    print("Alphabet is a vowel")
else:
    print("Alphabet is a consonant")

7.Write a Python program that takes the marks of five subjects from the user, calculates the percentage, and prints the grade based on the following conditions:

> 90%: Grade A
80% - 90%: Grade B
60% - 80%: Grade C
< 60%: Fail
sub1 = int(input("Enter marks of subject 1: "))
sub2 = int(input("Enter marks of subject 2: "))
sub3 = int(input("Enter marks of subject 3: "))
sub4 = int(input("Enter marks of subject 4: "))
sub5 = int(input("Enter marks of subject 5: "))
percentage = ((sub1+sub2+sub3+sub4+sub5)/500)*100
if percentage >= 90:
    print("Grade A")
elif percentage >= 80:
    print("Grade B")
elif percentage >= 60:
    print("Grade C")
else:
    print("Fail")

8.Write a Python program that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) from the user and performs the corresponding operation.

num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
operator = input("Enter an operator: ")
if operator == '+':
    print("Addition: ", num1+num2)
elif operator == '-':
    print("Subtraction: ", num1-num2)
elif operator == '*':
    print("Multiplication: ", num1*num2)
elif operator == '/':
    print("Division: ", num1/num2)
else:
    print("Invalid operator")

9.Write a Python program to check if a triangle is valid or not based on the lengths of its three sides. A triangle is valid if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.

side1 = int(input("Enter length of side 1: "))
side2 = int(input("Enter length of side 2: "))
side3 = int(input("Enter length of side 3: "))
if side1+side2>side3 and side1+side3>side2 and side2+side3>side1:
    print("Triangle is valid")
else:
    print("Triangle is not valid")

10.Write a Python program that checks if a number entered by the user is even or odd using conditional statements.

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num%2==0:
    print("Number is even")
else:
    print("Number is odd")
